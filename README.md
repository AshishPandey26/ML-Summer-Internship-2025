## 🔍 About
Over the summer of 2025, I worked as an intern on a Machine Learning journey where I tackled real-world problems through structured tasks and projects.  
This repo showcases all 9 projects I completed—ranging from data preprocessing to dashboard creation, model building, and more.

I didn’t just follow tutorials—I solved problems, Googled like a maniac, broke things, fixed them again, and learned what it means to *build*.
